# Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This is the repository for Kevin Roche's Getting and Cleaning Data course project. 

# Dataset

The dataset used is the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from UCI's Machine Learning Repository.

# Files

This repository contains the following files:

* ***run_analysis.R*** performs the following five steps, as detailed in the assignment:
        - 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
        - 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
        - 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
        - 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
        - 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* ***Codebook.md*** modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

* ***GettingAndCleaningDataFinal.txt*** is the final dataset that run_analysis.R produces.
